\title{Launch the MarConsNetApp Shiny Application}
\usage{
app()
}
\description{
`app()` initializes and runs the Maritimes Conservation Network
interactive dashboard built with Shiny. This application provides:
* Geographic and ecological overview of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in
  the Maritimes region.
* Filtering and exploration of indicator data by region, site, and project.
* Tabbed content including Management Effectiveness, Effectiveness Contributions,
Ecosystem Overview, and Threat Assessments.
* Dynamic plots, maps, tables, and interactive UI elements
  driven by reactive inputs and user selections.
}
\details{
The app loads pre-processed data targets from a **targets** data store, located
internally on the wpnsbio9039519.mar.dfo-mpo server and
uses the `MarConsNetAnalysis` package for indicator scoring and visualization.
It also provides exportable reports and contextual information for
selected MPAs. Without access to the internal server, this app will not run.
