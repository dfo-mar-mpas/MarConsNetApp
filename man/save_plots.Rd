\title{Save indicator plots to disk}
\usage{
save_plots(df, STORE = dirname(path_to_store()))
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing at minimum the columns:
\describe{
  \item{\code{plot}}{A list column of ggplot objects.}
  \item{\code{areaID}}{Character identifier for the conservation area.}
  \item{\code{indicator}}{Character identifier for the indicator.}
}}

\item{STORE}{Character string giving the base directory in which plots will
be saved. Defaults to the parent directory of the MarConsNet
targets store as determined by \code{\link{path_to_store}}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of file paths corresponding to plots that
were successfully saved.
}
\description{
Iterates over a data frame containing ggplot objects and saves
each valid plot to disk using a standardized file naming
convention based on area and indicator identifiers.
}
\details{
Plots associated with non-conservation areas or missing plot
objects are skipped.


For each row in \code{df}, this function:
\enumerate{
  \item Skips rows where the \code{plot} object is \code{NULL}.
  \item Skips rows associated with \code{"Non_Conservation_Area"}.
  \item Saves the plot as a PNG file under
        \code{STORE/data/plot/}.
  \item Constructs filenames of the form
        \code{plot_<areaID>_<indicator>.png}.
}

Filenames are sanitized using \code{make.names()} to ensure
compatibility across operating systems.

\examples{
#' \dontrun{
# Save plots generated for indicator scoring
plot_files <- save_plots(plot_df)

# Inspect saved file paths
print(plot_files)
}

\code{\link{path_to_store}} for determining the base storage
location.
