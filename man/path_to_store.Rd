\title{Locate the MarConsNet targets data store}
\usage{
path_to_store()
}
\value{
A character string giving the file path to the selected
MarConsNet targets data store.
}
\description{
Determines the appropriate file path to the
\code{MarConsNetTargets/app_targets} directory based on the
execution environment. The function checks a series of
predefined locations corresponding to common deployment
scenarios (e.g. Shiny Server, Linux samba share, Windows samba
share, or OneDrive-synchronized directories) and returns the
first valid path found.
}
\details{
If no expected directory is found, a warning is issued and the
current working directory is returned as a fallback.

A message is printed indicating which data store path is being
used.


The function checks for the data store in the following order:
\enumerate{
  \item \code{MarConsNetTargets/app_targets} relative to the
        current project directory (e.g. Shiny Server deployment)
  \item Linux samba share path
        (\code{/srv/sambashare/MarConsNet/...})
  \item Windows samba share UNC path
        (\code{//wpnsbio9039519.mar.dfo-mpo.ca/...})
  \item A OneDrive-synchronized directory defined by the
        \code{OneDriveCommercial} environment variable
}

This approach allows the same application code to run across
development, server, and analyst environments without manual
path reconfiguration.
